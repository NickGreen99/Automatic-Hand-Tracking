If you are installing on Windows, it's strongly recommended to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (`WSL`) with Ubuntu to run the .sh file. Keep in mind for the sh file to work the line endings need to be `LF` not `CRLF` which is the default for Windows system. Therefore you need a text editor to change it to `LF`, save and then run the following commands. Another thing you can do is run the shell script in WSL and drag the `.pt` files in the `checkpoints` folder.

```shell
cd checkpoints
bash download_ckpts.sh
cd ..
```
